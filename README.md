# Is Imagining a voice like listening to it? Evidence from ERPs 
#### Peiyun Zhou (pzhou5@illinois.edu)

If you are a fan of Harry Potter books and films, when you read Harry Potter’s lines in a book silently (e.g., “Give it here, Malfoy, or I’ll kick you off your broom"), you might “hear” actor Daniel Radcliff 's voice “saying” this line. This effect of mentally simulating the characteristics of a character’s voice during silent reading is called Auditory Imagery (Hubbard, 2010) or Auditory Perceptual Simulation (APS; Stites, Luke, & Christianson, 2013; Zhou & Christianson, 2016a,b).

This respoitory contains the data for an ERP study that investigated how auditory imagery of native and non-native speech affects language processing and comrepehension. The study has been published in Zhou, Garnsey, & Christianson (2018). The data includes individual ERP data when participants were performing auditory imagery of native and non-native English speech during silent reading vs. normal silent reading, and behavioral results from participants performing the Nelson-Denny Reading Comprehension task (Brown, Fishco, & Hanna, 1993) and Bucknell Auditory Imagery Scale (BAIS)(Herholz, Halpern, & Zatorre, 2012). The repository includes the R scripts used to carry out the statistical analyses reported in the original paper.
